# Twitter and Instagram Unfollow
With the twitter-unfollow.js or instagram-unfollow.js files included in the codes, you will be able to easily remove the followers you follow who do not follow you.

# How Unfollow Codes Work
1 - Select the code for Twitter and Instagram and copy all.

2 - Enter the code you copied on Twitter or Instagram and click on the ones you follow. Then right click and continue by saying "inspect the tutorial".

3 - From the item control tab, come to the console section and paste the given code.

⚠️ Warning: Instagram code will not work like twitter code. The Instagram code first scans and then subtracts.
